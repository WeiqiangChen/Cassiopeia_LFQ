Cassiopeia LFQ is an R script that uses knitr/LaTeX to automatically execute and report standard data analysis steps for label-free proteomics experimental data, such as quality control, differential expression testing (using the limma-trend testing procedure from the R Bioconductor package limma), and other insightful output (PCA, k-means clustering, etc.). It was developed to help out and automatize the LFQ data analysis in the Max Perutz Labs mass spectrometry service facility in Vienna. The script’s input is a “proteinGroups.txt” file as produced by database searching using the proteomic software platform MaxQuant, as well as manually specified parameters that determine what Cassiopeia is doing.
